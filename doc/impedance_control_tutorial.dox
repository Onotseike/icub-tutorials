@page icub_impedance_control_tutorial Getting accustomed with torque/impedance interfaces

This tutorial shows how to use the following interfaces:

yarp::dev::IControlMode

yarp::dev::ITorqueControl

yarp::dev::IImpedanceControl


\section sec_intro Introduction
Prerequisites:
http://wiki.icub.org/iCub/main/dox/html/icub_motor_control_tutorial.html

The code described in this tutorial can be found at:

<b>$ICUB_ROOT/tutorials/src/tutorial_arm_joint_impedance.cpp</b>

The example is based on the previous tutorial:

<b>$ICUB_ROOT/tutorials/src/tutorial_arm.cpp</b>

The example shows how to open the ITorqueControl to show the arm joint torques and how to change the control mode of the elbow joint from position to impedance control. 

A detailed reference of the yarp interfaces used in this tutorial(IControlMode,ITorqueControl,IImpedanceControl) can be found at:

\section sec_initialization Initialization

Let us assume the module wholeBodyTorqueObserver is up and running. The wholeBodyTorqueObserver module, based on the iDyn library (http://wiki.icub.org/iCub/dox/html/group__iDyn.html) acts as a server and is responsibile for the calculation of the joint torques.
In order to access to the torque values, our program has to declare and open the yarp ITorqueControl interface, in the same manner as you
open the iPositionControl interface (see previous tutorial: http://wiki.icub.org/iCub/dox/html/icub_motor_control_tutorial.html).
We can also open the IControlMode interface (resposibile to set the control mode of each joint (position/velocity/impedance etc.) and the IImpedanceControl interface, used to set the impedance paramteres (joint stiffness/ joint damping etc). 

\code
    IPositionControl *pos;
    IEncoders *encs;
    IControlMode *ictrl;
    IImpedanceControl *iimp;
    ITorqueControl *itrq;
\endcode

and:

\code
    bool ok;
    ok = robotDevice.view(pos);
    ok = ok && robotDevice.view(encs);
    ok = ok && robotDevice.view(ictrl);
    ok = ok && robotDevice.view(iimp);
    ok = ok && robotDevice.view(itrq);

    if (!ok) {
        printf("Problems acquiring interfaces\n");
        return 0;
    }
\endcode

We can thus start with checking how many axes we can control by doing:

\code
    int jnts = 0;
    pos->getAxes(&jnts);
\endcode

Let's create some vectors for later use:
\code
    Vector tmp;
    Vector encoders;
    Vector command_position;
    Vector command_velocity;

    tmp.resize(jnts);
    encoders.resize(jnts);
    ...
\endcode

Let's now initialize the controllers and start up the amplifiers:

\code
    // we need to set reference accelerations used to generate the velocity
    // profile, here 50 degrees/sec^2
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < jnts; i++) {
        tmp[i] = 50.0;
    }
    pos->setRefAccelerations(tmp.data());
    for (i = 0; i < jnts; i++) {
        tmp[i] = 10.0;
        pos->setRefSpeed(i, tmp[i]);
    }
\endcode

if needed we can check the position of our axes by doing:

\code
  enc->getEncoders(encoders.data());
\endcode

which reads the values of the motor encoders into a vector of doubles of size ''jnts''. 

\section sec_position Position control

First do:
\code
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < jnts; i++) {
      tmp[i] = 40.0;
  }
  pos->setRefSpeeds(tmp.data());
\endcode

which sets the reference speed for all axes to 40 degrees per second. The reference speed is used 
to interpolate the trajectory between the current and the desired position.

Now you can do:
\code
  bool ok = pos->positionMove(command_position.data());
\endcode

where ''command_position'' is the desired position. This starts a movement of all axes toward 
the desired position.

\section sec_torque_reading Reading the torques of a joint
You can use the ITorqueControl interface to read the torque at a specific joint.
\code
Vector torques;
torques.resize(nj);
itrq->getTorques(torques.data());
\endcode

\section sec_impedance Using different control modes: Impedance Position Control

You can change the impedence parameters of a joint at any time:
\code
  double stiffness = 0.111;   // stiffness coefficient, units are Nm/deg
  double damping =  0.014;    // damping coefficient,   units are Nm/(deg/s)
  double offset = 0.0;		  // torque offset,         units are Nm
  bool ok = iimp->setImpedance(joint, stiffness, damping, offset);
\endcode

You can use iIControlMode interface to change the control mode of a specific joint to impedance mode:

\code
ictrl->setImpedancePositionMode(3);
\endcode

When in impedance position mode, the low level controller (DSP) computes a refence torque Td as:

\f[ T_d = K_{spring} * (q-q_d) + K_{damp} * \dot{q} + F_{offset} \f]

which is tracked by the internal PID regulator.

NOTE: When you enter in impedance mode from a different control mode, the equilibrium position of the joint is the current position of the joint.

You can specify a new equilibrium position using the usual position interface. 

\code
bool ok = pos->positionMove(command_position.data());
\endcode

If you need to change it back to position (stiff) mode:

\code
ictrl->setPositionMode(jnt);
\endcode

An ImpedanceVelocity control mode is also available.
In this control modality you can use vel->VelocityMove() command in order to command a velocity while mantaining the impedance specified with the iimp->setImpedance(joint, stiffness, damping, dorce_offset) command.

\section sec_torque_control Using different control modes: Torque Control

Torque control mode can be used to directly specify a reference torque at a joint. 

\code
ictrl->setTorqueMode(jnt);

double jnt_torque= 0.0; //expressed in Nm
itrq->setRefTorque(jnt_torque); 
\endcode

The gains of the PID controller resposibile of tracking the torque reference can be obtained using iTorqueControl::getTorquePid() method.

NOTE: the reference torque that you can specify on the icub joints is limited (clamped) to:

+8  -8  Nm for the arm joints

+12 -12 Nm for the leg joints

NOTE2: near the hardware limits of the robot, the torque PID controlled is disabled, in order to prevent to command a torque againts the hardware limits. The PID controller is automatically re-enabled  as soon as the joint is moved far the limits (You can view the value of the limites using the IControlLimits interface).

NOTE3: during calibration/parking of the robot, iCubInterface automatically sets the control mode of all the joints to position control (stiff mode). 

NOTE4: If your application changes the control mode of one joint, it's good practice to reset it to the previous modality when your application quits.

\section sec_closing Closing the device

When you are done with controlling the robot don't forget to close the device:
\code
  robotDevice.close();
\endcode
